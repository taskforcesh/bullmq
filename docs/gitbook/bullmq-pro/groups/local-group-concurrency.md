# Local group concurrency

It is also possible to set a specific concurrency value to a given group. This is useful if you require that different groups should run with different concurrency factors.

Please keep in mind that when specifying a group's concurrency factor, you are storing this value in Redis, so it is your responsibility to remove it if you are not using it anymore.

You can use the `setGroupConcurrency` method like this:

```typescript
import { QueuePro } from '@taskforcesh/bullmq-pro';

const queue = new QueuePro('myQueue', { connection });
const groupId = 'my group';
await queue.setGroupConcurrency(groupId, 4);
```

And you can use the `getGroupConcurrency` method like this:

```typescript
const concurrency = await queue.getGroupConcurrency(groupId);
```
