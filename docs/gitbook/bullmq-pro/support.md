# Support

With your BullMQ Pro subscription, you receive commercial support. For the most recent and detailed terms, please refer to the "[BullMQ Pro](https://taskforce.sh/account/bullmqpro)" tab in your account. Here's a broad overview of what's included:

* Email-based support: Customers may submit issues or queries via email to our dedicated support email address (support@taskforce.sh).
* Response time: We aim to respond to support emails within one business day (business days are defined in section 4). However, response times may vary, and quicker responses may occur on a best-effort basis.
* Resolution time: The time it takes to resolve an issue depends on the nature of the issue. Simple queries or requests for advice may be resolved quickly. More complex issues, such as bugs, may take several days or more to resolve. In some cases, we may not be able to fully resolve an issue but will provide a workaround.
