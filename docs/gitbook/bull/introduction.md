# Introduction

Bull (also called Bull v3.x) is the legacy version of BullMQ. As it is still heavily used today, it is also maintained for bugs but not for new features. If you want to use a battle tested queue library and you do not need a better typescript integration nor the latest features you are good to go using this library for years to come.
