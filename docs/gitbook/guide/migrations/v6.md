# Migration to v6

Make sure to pass **skipMigrationsExecution** option in any of our instances as false in order to execute all necessary changes when coming from an older version

## Migration of deprecated paused key

If you have paused queues after upgrading to this version. These jobs will be moved to wait state when initializing any of our instances (Worker, Queue, QueueEvents or FlowProducer).

Paused key is not longer needed as this state is already represented inside meta key. It also improves the process of pausing or resuming a queue as we don't need to rename any key.

## Remove legacy markers

When migrating from versions before v5.
It's recommended to do this process:

1. Pause your queues.
2. Upgrade to v6.
3. Instantiate any instance passing skipMigrationsExecution option as false where migrations will be executed.
4. Resume your queues.

This way you will prevent that your workers pick a legacy marker that is no longer used because new markers are added in a different structure.
