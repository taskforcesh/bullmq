# Adding flows in bulk

Sometimes it is necessary to atomically add flows in bulk. For example, there could be a requirement that all the flows must be created or none of them. Also, adding flows in bulk can be faster since it reduces the number of roundtrips to Redis:

```typescript
import { FlowProducer } from 'bullmq';

const flow = new FlowProducer({ connection });

const trees = await flow.addBulk([
  {
    name: 'root-job-1',
    queueName: 'rootQueueName-1',
    data: {},
    children: [
      {
        name,
        data: { idx: 0, foo: 'bar' },
        queueName: 'childrenQueueName-1',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    name: 'root-job-2',
    queueName: 'rootQueueName-2',
    data: {},
    children: [
      {
        name,
        data: { idx: 1, foo: 'baz' },
        queueName: 'childrenQueueName-2',
      },
    ],
  },
]);
```

This call can only succeed or fail, and all or none of the jobs will be added.
