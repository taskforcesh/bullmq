# Global Concurrency

The global concurrency factor is a queue option that determines how many jobs are allowed to be processed in parallel across all your worker instances.

```typescript
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';

await queue.setGlobalConcurrency(4);
```

And in order to get this value:

```typescript
const globalConcurrency = await queue.getGlobalConcurrency();
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that if you choose a concurrency level in your workers, it will not override the global one, it will just be the maximum jobs a given worker can process in parallel but never more than the global one.
{% endhint %}
