# Prioritized

Jobs can also include a `priority` option. Using priorities, job processing order will be affected by the specified `priority` instead of following a FIFO or LIFO pattern.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Adding prioritized jobs is a slower operation than the other types of jobs, with a complexity `O(log(n))` relative to the number of jobs in the prioritized set in the queue.
{% endhint %}

Note that the priorities go from `1` to `2 097 152`, where a lower number is always a **higher** priority than higher numbers.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Jobs without a `priority` assigned will get the highest priority, being processed before jobs with priorities assigned to them.
{% endhint %}

```typescript
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';

const myQueue = new Queue('Paint');

await myQueue.add('wall', { color: 'pink' }, { priority: 10 });
await myQueue.add('wall', { color: 'brown' }, { priority: 5 });
await myQueue.add('wall', { color: 'blue' }, { priority: 7 });

// The wall will be painted first brown, then blue and
// finally pink.
```

If several jobs are added with the same priority value, then the jobs within that priority will be processed in [FIFO (_First in, first out_)](../fifo.md) fashion.

## Change priority

If you want to change the `priority` after inserting a job, use the **`changePriority`** method. For example, let's say that you want to change the `priority` from `16` to `1`:

```typescript
const job = await Job.create(queue, 'test2', { foo: 'bar' }, { priority: 16 });

await job.changePriority({
  priority: 1,
});
```

or if you want to use the [LIFO (_Last In, First Out_)](../lifo.md) option:

```typescript
const job = await Job.create(queue, 'test2', { foo: 'bar' }, { priority: 16 });

await job.changePriority({
  lifo: true,
});
```

## Get Prioritized jobs

As prioritized is a new state. You must use **`getJobs`** or **`getPrioritized`** method as:

```typescript
const jobs = await queue.getJobs(['prioritized']);

const jobs2 = await queue.getPrioritized();
```
