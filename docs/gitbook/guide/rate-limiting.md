# Rate limiting

BullMQ provides rate limiting for the queues. It is possible to configure the workers so that they obey a given rate limiting option:

```typescript
import { Worker, QueueScheduler } from 'bullmq';

const worker = new Worker('painter', async job => paintCar(job), {
  limiter: {
    max: 10,
    duration: 1000,
  },
});

const scheduler = new QueueScheduler('painter');
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Jobs that get rate limited will actually stay in waiting state.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
From BullMQ 2.0 and onwards, the QueueScheduler is not needed anymore.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The rate limiter is global, so if you have for example 10 workers for one queue with the above settings, still only 10 jobs will be processed by second.
{% endhint %}

### Group keys

{% hint style="danger" %}
From BullMQ 3.0 and onwards, group keys support is removed to improve global rate limit, so the information below is only valid for older versions.
{% endhint %}

It is also possible to define a rate limiter based on group keys, for example you may want to have a rate limiter per _customer_ instead of a global rate limiter for all customers:

```typescript
import { Queue, Worker, QueueScheduler } from 'bullmq';

const queue = new Queue('painter', {
  limiter: {
    groupKey: 'customerId',
  },
});

const worker = new Worker('painter', async job => paintCar(job), {
  limiter: {
    max: 10,
    duration: 1000,
    groupKey: 'customerId',
  },
});

const scheduler = new QueueScheduler('painter');

// jobs will be rate limited by the value of customerId key:
await queue.add('rate limited paint', { customerId: 'my-customer-id' });
```

### Manual rate-limit

Sometimes is useful to rate-limit a queue manually instead of based on some static options. For example, if you have an API that returns 429 (Too many requests), and you want to rate-limit the queue based on that response.

For this purpose, you can use the worker method **rateLimit** like this:

```typescript
import { Worker } from 'bullmq';

const worker = new Worker(
  'myQueue',
  async () => {
    const [isRateLimited, duration] = await doExternalCall();
    if (isRateLimited) {
      await worker.rateLimit(duration);
      // Do not forget to throw this special exception,
      // since we must differentiate this case from a failure
      // in order to move the job to wait again.
      throw Worker.RateLimitError();
    }
  },
  {
    connection,
  },
);
```

### Get Queue Rate Limit Ttl

Sometimes is useful to know if our queue is rate limited.

For this purpose, you can use the **getRateLimitTtl** method like this:

```typescript
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';

const queue = new Queue('myQueue', { connection });

const ttl = await queue.getRateLimitTtl();

if (ttl > 0) {
  console.log('Queue is rate limited');
}
```
