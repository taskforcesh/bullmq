## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(name, opts)](./bullmq.queue3._constructor_.md) |  | This is the Queue constructor. It creates a new Queue that is persisted in Redis. Every time the same queue is instantiated it tries to process all the old jobs that may exist from a previous unfinished session. |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [name](./bullmq.queue3.name.md) |  | string | The name of the queue |
|  [queueEvents](./bullmq.queue3.queueevents.md) |  | [QueueEvents](./bullmq.queueevents.md) |  |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [add(jobName, data, opts)](./bullmq.queue3.add.md) |  |  |
|  [base64Name()](./bullmq.queue3.base64name.md) |  | Returns Queue name in base64 encoded format |
|  [clean(grace, limit, type)](./bullmq.queue3.clean.md) |  | Tells the queue remove all jobs created outside of a grace period in milliseconds. You can clean the jobs with the following states: completed, wait (typo for waiting), active, delayed, and failed. |
|  [clientName()](./bullmq.queue3.clientname.md) |  | Returns Queue name with keyPrefix (default: 'bull') |
|  [close()](./bullmq.queue3.close.md) |  | Closes the underlying redis client. Use this to perform a graceful shutdown.<code>close</code> can be called from anywhere, with one caveat: if called from within a job handler the queue won't close until after the job has been processed |
|  [count()](./bullmq.queue3.count.md) |  | Returns a promise that returns the number of jobs in the queue, waiting or paused. Since there may be other processes adding or processing jobs, this value may be true only for a very small amount of time. |

|  [on(event, callback)](./bullmq.queue3.on_1.md) |  | An error occurred |
|  [on(event, callback)](./bullmq.queue3.on_2.md) |  | A Job is waiting to be processed as soon as a worker is idling. |

|  [pause()](./bullmq.queue3.pause.md) |  | Returns a promise that resolves when the queue is paused.<!-- -->A paused queue will not process new jobs until resumed, but current jobs being processed will continue until they are finalized. The pause can be either global or local. If global, all workers in all queue instances for a given queue will be paused. If local, just this worker will stop processing new jobs after the current lock expires. This can be useful to stop a worker from taking new jobs prior to shutting down.<!-- -->Pausing a queue that is already paused does nothing. |
|  [pauseWorker(doNotWaitActive)](./bullmq.queue3.pauseworker.md) |  |  |
|  [process(processor)](./bullmq.queue3.process.md) |  | Defines a processing function for the jobs placed into a given Queue.<!-- -->The callback is called every time a job is placed in the queue. It is passed an instance of the job as first argument.<!-- -->If the callback signature contains the second optional done argument, the callback will be passed a done callback to be called after the job has been completed. The done callback can be called with an Error instance, to signal that the job did not complete successfully, or with a result as second argument (e.g.: done(null, result);) when the job is successful. Errors will be passed as a second argument to the "failed" event; results, as a second argument to the "completed" event.<!-- -->If, however, the callback signature does not contain the done argument, a promise must be returned to signal job completion. If the promise is rejected, the error will be passed as a second argument to the "failed" event. If it is resolved, its value will be the "completed" event's second argument. |
|  [removeAllListeners(event)](./bullmq.queue3.removealllisteners.md) |  |  |
|  [removeListener(event, listener)](./bullmq.queue3.removelistener.md) |  |  |
|  [removeRepeatable(name, opts)](./bullmq.queue3.removerepeatable.md) |  | Removes a given repeatable job. The RepeatOptions and JobId needs to be the same as the ones used for the job when it was added.<!-- -->name: The name of the to be removed job |
|  [removeRepeatableByKey(repeatJobKey)](./bullmq.queue3.removerepeatablebykey.md) |  | Removes a given repeatable job by key. |
|  [resume()](./bullmq.queue3.resume.md) |  | Returns a promise that resolves when the queue is resumed after being paused.<!-- -->The resume can be either local or global. If global, all workers in all queue instances for a given queue will be resumed. If local, only this worker will be resumed. Note that resuming a queue globally will not resume workers that have been paused locally; for those, resume(true) must be called directly on their instances.<!-- -->Resuming a queue that is not paused does nothing. |
|  [resumeWorker()](./bullmq.queue3.resumeworker.md) |  |  |
|  [retryJob(job)](./bullmq.queue3.retryjob.md) |  |  |
|  [setWorkerName()](./bullmq.queue3.setworkername.md) |  | Set clientName to Redis.client |
