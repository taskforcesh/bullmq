## Queue3.resume() method

Returns a promise that resolves when the queue is resumed after being paused.

The resume can be either local or global. If global, all workers in all queue instances for a given queue will be resumed. If local, only this worker will be resumed. Note that resuming a queue globally will not resume workers that have been paused locally; for those, resume(true) must be called directly on their instances.

Resuming a queue that is not paused does nothing.
