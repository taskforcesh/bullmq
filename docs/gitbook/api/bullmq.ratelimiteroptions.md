## RateLimiterOptions interface

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface RateLimiterOptions 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [duration](./bullmq.ratelimiteroptions.duration.md) | number | Time in milliseconds. During this time, a maximum of <code>max</code> jobs will be processed. |
|  [groupKey?](./bullmq.ratelimiteroptions.groupkey.md) | string | <i>(Optional)</i> It is possible to define a rate limiter based on group keys, for example you may want to have a rate limiter per customer instead of a global rate limiter for all customers |
|  [max](./bullmq.ratelimiteroptions.max.md) | number | Max number of jobs to process in the time period specified in <code>duration</code>. |
|  [workerDelay?](./bullmq.ratelimiteroptions.workerdelay.md) | boolean | <i>(Optional)</i> This option enables a heuristic so that when a queue is heavily rete limited, it delays the workers so that they do not try to pick jobs when there is no point in doing so. Note: It is not recommended to use this option when using groupKeys unless you have a big amount of workers since you may be delaying workers that could pick jobs in groups that have not been rate limited. |
