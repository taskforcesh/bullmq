## Queue3.process() method

Defines a processing function for the jobs placed into a given Queue.

The callback is called every time a job is placed in the queue. It is passed an instance of the job as first argument.

If the callback signature contains the second optional done argument, the callback will be passed a done callback to be called after the job has been completed. The done callback can be called with an Error instance, to signal that the job did not complete successfully, or with a result as second argument (e.g.: done(null, result);) when the job is successful. Errors will be passed as a second argument to the "failed" event; results, as a second argument to the "completed" event.

If, however, the callback signature does not contain the done argument, a promise must be returned to signal job completion. If the promise is rejected, the error will be passed as a second argument to the "failed" event. If it is resolved, its value will be the "completed" event's second argument.
