## Queue3.pause() method

Returns a promise that resolves when the queue is paused.

A paused queue will not process new jobs until resumed, but current jobs being processed will continue until they are finalized. The pause can be either global or local. If global, all workers in all queue instances for a given queue will be paused. If local, just this worker will stop processing new jobs after the current lock expires. This can be useful to stop a worker from taking new jobs prior to shutting down.

Pausing a queue that is already paused does nothing.
