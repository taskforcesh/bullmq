--[[
  Move next job to be processed to active, lock it and fetch its data. The job
  may be delayed, in that case we need to move it to the delayed set instead.

  This operation guarantees that the worker owns the job during the lock
  expiration time. The worker is responsible of keeping the lock fresh
  so that no other worker picks this job again.

  Input:
    KEYS[1] wait key
    KEYS[2] active key
    KEYS[3] prioritized key
    KEYS[4] stream events key
    KEYS[5] stalled key

    -- Rate limiting
    KEYS[6] rate limiter key
    KEYS[7] delayed key

    -- Promote delayed jobs
    KEYS[8] paused key
    KEYS[9] meta key
    KEYS[10] pc priority counter

    -- Arguments
    ARGV[1] key prefix
    ARGV[2] timestamp
    ARGV[3] optional job ID
    ARGV[4] opts

    opts - token - lock token
    opts - lockDuration
    opts - limiter
